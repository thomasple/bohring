# Physical constants

`UnitSystem` exposes physical constants as ordinary Python `float` properties.
Each dimensional value is expressed in that system's coherent units, so it can
be used directly in numerical formulas. `ALPHA` and `N_A` are dimensionless and
retain their stated values in every system; `N_A` is a particle count, matching
the library's dimensionless `mol` convention.

```python
from hartreez import UnitSystem, au

md = UnitSystem(length="angstrom", time="ps", energy="kcal/mol")
thermal_energy = 300.0 * md.K_B
one_ev_in_hartree = md.EV  # Unit factors and constants are both floats.

assert au.HBAR == 1.0
assert au.M_E == 1.0
assert au.E_CHARGE == 1.0
```

## Public constants

| Property | Definition and dimensions | Provenance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `K_B` | Boltzmann constant, energy / temperature | Exact SI defining value, `1.380649e-23 J/K` |
| `HBAR` | Reduced Planck constant, energy × time | `PLANCK / (2 pi)` |
| `PLANCK` | Planck constant, energy × time | Exact SI defining value, `6.62607015e-34 J s` |
| `C_LIGHT` | Speed of light, length / time | Exact SI defining value, `299792458 m/s` |
| `ALPHA` | Fine-structure constant, dimensionless | CODATA 2022 central value, `7.2973525643e-3` |
| `M_E` | Electron mass | CODATA 2022, `9.1093837139e-31 kg` |
| `M_P` | Proton mass | CODATA 2022, `1.67262192595e-27 kg` |
| `E_CHARGE` | Elementary charge magnitude | Exact SI defining value, `1.602176634e-19 C` |
| `N_A` | Avogadro particle count, dimensionless | Exact SI defining value, `6.02214076e23` |
| `EPSILON_0` | Vacuum permittivity, charge² / (energy × length) | Derived as `e² / (4 pi alpha hbar c)` |
| `K_E` | Coulomb constant, energy × length / charge² | Derived as `1 / (4 pi epsilon_0)` |

Measured inputs are pinned to the [NIST CODATA 2022
release](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html), and exact inputs
follow the [BIPM SI defining constants](https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/si-defining-constants).
Derived constants share these inputs rather than repeating rounded table
values. The source values and immutable dimensioned registry are in
`hartreez.constants`, separately from the unit registry.

The default `au` uses bohr, atomic time, Hartree, elementary charge, and kelvin.
This makes `au.HBAR`, `au.M_E`, `au.E_CHARGE`, `au.BOHR`, and `au.HARTREE`
approximately one. The electrostatic constants satisfy `au.K_E ≈ 1` and
`au.EPSILON_0 ≈ 1/(4 pi)` under the SI coherent Coulomb convention.

For an MD system using `kcal/mol` and kelvin, `K_B` is about
`0.00198720425864083 kcal mol^-1 K^-1`; for example, multiplying by a
temperature in kelvin gives thermal energy in the selected energy unit.
